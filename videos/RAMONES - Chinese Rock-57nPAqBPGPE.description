Somebody calls me on the phone
Say hey-hey-hey is Johnny home
You wanna take a walk
You wanna go cop
You wanna go get some Chinese rock

I'm livin' on a Chinese rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm livin' on a Chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop

The plaster fallin' off the wall
My girlfriend cryin' in the shower stall
It's hot as a bitch
I should've been rich
But I'm just diggin' a Chinese ditch
