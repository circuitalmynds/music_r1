00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
  

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.670
You're wearing pants with a tag at the back

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.690
and a cap with the visor turned up,

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:23.030
parading yourself all around Toleto

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.630
just like a bully trying to show off!

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.760
You wanna be american,
american, americano,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.019
listen here: who asked you to?

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:39.669
You want to be all trendy,

00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:41.860
but when you drink "whisky &amp; soda"

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.470
you can only end up sick!

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.470
You dance the rock &amp; roll,
and play the baseball,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.860
but where'd you get the cash?

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.320
for the Camel cigarettes?

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.970
Mummy's handbag!

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.049
&gt;&gt; You're acting all american,
american, americano,

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:01.379
but you're born in Italy, 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:02.379
listen here:
there's nothing you can do,

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.070
ok napoletano?!

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.760

[missing verse]
 "How can your loved one understand?"

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.780
"if you're speaking half americano?"

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.869
"When you're out loving uder such a moon,"

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.940
"where do you get a phrase
 like "AI LAVIU'"?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200
#second solo#

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.730
